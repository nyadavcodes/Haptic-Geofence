# Haptic-Geofence
This is Haptic Geofence library â€“ developed for haptic communication based on the GPS data and a predefined static geofence. It was originally tested with Adafruit GPS Module (Product ID: 746), Adafruit Haptic Motor Controller (Product ID: 2305) and Adafruit Flora Microcontroller (Product ID: 659).

The current code includes geofence calculations based on a desired radius from a fixed location coordinates using the Haversine formula. It also triggers a haptic feedback when the GPS position is determined to be inside the geofence.
